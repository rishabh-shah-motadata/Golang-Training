The json.Decoder is better that io.ReadAll + json.UnMarshal because the json.Decoder process the data in chunks (in the form of streams).
Whereas the io.ReadAll saves the whole data into memory (in the form of []byte) and then parses it via json.UnMarshal.
The later option consumes much memory as it loads whole req body in the memory. So, this becomes hindrance when the req body is large.
