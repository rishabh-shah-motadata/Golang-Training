How to generate cpu profile via commands:
- curl "http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30" -o cpu.pprof  // This will generate 30 seconds graph of CPU cycle. Make sure to run your code in between this time
- go tool pprof -http=:8081 cpu.pprof // This will open a pprof UI in web where we can analyze it.

Another way is using below command:
- go tool pprof go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30 // This will open up pprof cli
- pdf // to generate in pdf
  or
- svg // to generate in svg
We will be able to see different visualizations by using cli but the former option gives us flexibility to view in different visualizations.
